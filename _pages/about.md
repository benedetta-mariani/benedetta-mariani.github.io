I'm a Phd student in Neuroscience at the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it) and I am part of the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics ([Liph Lab](https://www.liphlab.com/)) of the University of Padova.

I've got a bachelor degree in Physics from the University of Padova and a Master Degree in Physics of Complex Systems from the University of Turin. Then I became fascinated by the possible applications of the physics of complex systems to the Computational Neuroscience world, and decided indeed to dive into this field.

In particular I have been studying the brain criticality hypothesis in the rat barrel cortex, with the particular focus on studying perturbed states (see [here]). I also focused on disentangling the contributions of external and intrinsic dynamics to the signatures of criticality in the barrel cortex (see [here]())

I am in general interested in studying collective properties like the oscillatory behavior and synchronization phenomena observed in the barrel cortex during 
the processing of a sensory input and in understanding their functional role.

The methods I am interested in are massive data analysis and computational modeling.
