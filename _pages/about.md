I'm Benedetta Mariani and I'm a Phd student in Neuroscience at the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it) and I am part of the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics ([Liph Lab](https://www.liphlab.com/)) of the University of Padova.

I got a bachelor degree in Physics from the University of Padova and a Master Degree in Physics of Complex Systems from the University of Turin. Then I became fascinated from the possible applications of the physics of complex systems to the Computational Neuroscience world, and decided indeed to dive into this field.
