I'm a PhD student in Neuroscience at the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it) and I am part of the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics ([Liph Lab](https://www.liphlab.com/)) of the University of Padova.

I've got a bachelor degree in Physics from the University of Padova and a Master Degree in Physics of Complex Systems from the University of Turin. Then I've become fascinated by the possible applications of the physics of complex systems to the Computational Neuroscience world, and decided indeed to dive into this field.

I am supervised by [Samir Suweis](https://suweis.github.io/), and collaborate with the laboratory of [Stefano Vassanelli](https://www.vassanellilab.eu/people/) and with [Ramon Guevara Erra](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/27121/overview).

I have been studying the brain criticality hypothesis in the rat barrel cortex, focusing in particular on studying criticality in perturbed conditions (see [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.709677/full)). I also focused on disentangling the contributions of external and intrinsic dynamics on the signatures of criticality in the barrel cortex (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05070)).

I am in general interested in studying collective properties like the oscillatory behavior and synchronization phenomena observed in the barrel cortex during 
the processing of a sensory input and in understanding their functional role.

The methods I am interested in are massive data analysis and computational modeling.
